# Assets Directory

This directory contains assets for the application:
- icon.ico - Windows icon
- icon.icns - macOS icon
- icon.png - Linux icon (256x256)

These icons are used during the build process to create platform-specific executables with proper application icons.

Note: You will need to add appropriate icon files in this directory before building the application.
